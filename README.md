# Snapagram
Social media project for UC Berkeley's premier iOS development course. 

This project uses local data that displays images in two formats: threads and feeds. Threads show a collection of images that can only be viewed once, similar to Snapchat. Feeds show a collection of images that can be viewed in a scrollable format, similar to Instagram. 

We are currently working on a transition from local storage to a database. This will also include an authentication system.
